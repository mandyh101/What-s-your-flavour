# What's your flavour!
This is a starter project I created in Dev Academy to practice building react components with local state. I also wanted to add the challenge of consuming a web API. With each new feature I have worked on testing files too to practice my skill in this area

## Tech stack
Javascript, HTML, CSS, express


## Setup

```sh
cd react-to-web-api
npm install
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run
npm run dev
```

* Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
## Getting Started

What's your flavour is the web application for the adventurous chef. Not sure what to cook, but ready to try something completely new? Simply select your main ingredient from the drop down and the application will do the rest.
You'll be provided with a combination of herbs and spices to use to enhance the flavour of your dish. If you like what you see, select, let's cook and you'll be able to choose from a range of recipes filtered by your chosen ingredients.
Don't like what you see? Simply hit the button to try another flavour combination!
